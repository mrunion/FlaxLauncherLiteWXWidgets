# FlaxLauncherLite #

## This project is very experimental! ##

Flax Launcher Lite is a Flax Engine launcher for MacOS, Linux and Windows. It is a very first pass and
has only been compiled and tested under MacOS. This launcher has only the most basic features. It allows:

- Adding Flax Engine versions to the Engine list
- Adding Existing Flax projects to the Project list
- Creating a new Flax Project with the chosen engine

This project was created since the current Flax Launcher only works under Windows.
